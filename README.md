# Cyb Mail Sender

WordPress plugin to add `Sender` header to wp_mail and fix [the issue with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22837).

Additionally, it set the "From" field to `Blog name <blog@email>` (configured in Settings->General).
